        Building for Humanity: Creation Benefits All.<br>
        I have a personal motto to create useful things that broadly benefit people. 
        I believe that the first step in creating something useful is to start small and just make something. 
        I find happiness in the process of making things myself. 
        I studied mechanical engineering in university. 
        My interest in cars and robots led me to an enthusiasm for automated mechanical systems, 
        and this interest evolved into a curiosity about deep learning. 
        For a class project during my undergraduate studues, 
        I worked with a small automated guided vehicle (AGV) model based on an RGB camera and 2D LiDAR. 
        Designing the driving algorithm, 
        I saw how effective deep learning could be in handling complex external environments 
        that are difficult to address with human-based heuristic algorithms. 
        This experience prompted me to focus on the potential of deep learning models 
        and pursue graduate studies in artificial intelligence. 
        In grad school, I worked on projects related to code search and generation, 
        as well as data creation driven by large language models.
